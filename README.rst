sefara
======

Sefara is a small Python library to help manage the datasets used in
scientific analysis projects.

You might consider using Sefara if you find yourself:

* hard coding paths and metadata for input files in analysis scripts or IPython notebooks
* copy and pasting paths from a spreadsheet into the shell to run commandline tools
* defining lots of environment variables giving paths to commonly analyzed datasets

Sefara improves over these common workflows by providing programmatic
and commandline interfaces for specifying, grouping, and filtering
datasets.

Sefara works well for analyses involving hundreds to perhaps a few
thousand datasets. If you need to manage many more datasets than that,
you probably need a more sophisticated solution.
